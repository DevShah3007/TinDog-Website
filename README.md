# TinDog-Website
Inspired by tinder, I made tindog. Sounds funny na? I knew it!!

Tindog is just a static web-site highlighting HTML, CSS and BootStrap skills I learned so far. I have put them together in this web-page

It is just meant for showing how a commercial website made by me in future will look like in terms of designing and element structure.
